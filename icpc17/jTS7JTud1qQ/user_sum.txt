why can having class variables in public mess up a program 
But why do I have to take the long path creating a private variable and then having to make two public functions in order to get the variable when I can just make a public variable I dont understand whats the big deal
How can we use the variable name in the setName and getName functions before the variable is declared itself I thought C had a topdown execution
Man Im Confused I did everything correct but its not running and its saying CreateProccess  No such File Or Directory
How can a variable name declared in private be used in public  Can anyone please clarify 
Do you need a different object for every variable
if your using more than one string would you have to make another function just to return it 
which compiler you are using
that means that if we want to build variables in private we need to create two functions for every one of variables  isnt a lot of work 
cant you just put string name in the parenthesis why is x that important

why can having class variables in public mess up a program
why make two functions if you can do this string getNamestring x name  x return name
when would you make a variable public and exactly what problems could it cause
i never could understand what is the use of includeiostream or includestring can someone explain
"how can i code it if i want to prompt the user to enter the name and store in the private variable that means that if we want to build variables in private we need to create two functions for every one of variables  isnt a lot of work"
if you dont set a variable in class private or public what is the default
So youre making it private only to make it public but its still private I understand you make a public so you can access it in the main function Im just confused as to how it matters if its private if youre making it public I think I just dont understand the private part When would you only want to set it to private to only use it in the class Can you give me a scenario where that would occur
Why not just have the return name inside the setname function of course change the return type as well
Will calling get and set slower than accessing the variable in c Javascript will so i am thinking will c affect the performance
What is the benefit in making your variables private and having to jump through hoops to get them

hello what is the difference between setName and getName i am confused about the two
hi im 12 and in my function that returns the string variable i get an error that says the variable wa not declared in this scope
tell me the difference between public and private
Okay Need to clear some of my doubts here Can anyone tell me the different between class and struct  Because I know that both need object to be use inside main but I need more explanation 
Would it not be better practice to declare the private variables before the public functions
Can anyone explain why we need include string because I deleted it and it still worked
what compiler are you using

If you did all that so that people couldnt access the variable surely they could access the function to change the variable anyway
why is setname void 
if you dont set a variable in class private or public what is the default 
How do I know when I should use   and when I shouldn’t
cant you just put string name in the parenthesis why is x that important
Im kind of confused How come the variable name did not have to go before the functions getName and setName
how come he doesnt put  behind string name in the private class
Do you need a different object for every variable
How would I be able to do this with multiple variables Would I have to put each variable in the parameter where he has string x
Why do you have to place return name

can someone explain when i dont put the include string the program still works help
Thanks a lot  i was wondering if we can put the setName and the getName functions together in one function public void setgetNamestring anameacout  a  endlits working  but is it right 
How does the compiler know what the variable name is if you are not declaring it until after the functions
So variables being private is better practice but sometime and some variables need to be public Ok what would be an example of a variable that would need to be public
You didnt ever really explain why youd ever want a private section in classes Youre just hiding it from yourself
hello what is the difference between setName and getName i am confused about the two
In one of the previous videos bucky mentioned compilers compiles line by lineSo when it comes to line 8the variable name is not yet createdso the compiler should point it out as an errorright Thanks in advance
Could someone please explain to me why he used string getName instead of void getName
the function setName is already include the name in the class what is the use of private string name over there
Is there any Tutorials for INLINE FUNCTIONS  Im so undone with that thing
